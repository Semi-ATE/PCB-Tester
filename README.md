# PCB-Tester

A `PCB-Tester` is a setup that is used to test a PCB.

The tool is used either in new production and/or repair.

It consists out of the following components:

* Rack --> 19", holds the 'instruments' of choice when implementing a tester for a specific PCB
* Housing --> holds the base of the PCB-Tester (1x PCB-Tester-Board and 0 or more PCB-Relay-Boards)
* Fixture --> mounted on the `Housing`, and implements the "moving mechanics"
* JIG --> not part of this project, belongs to a specific implementation, it is the 'needle-bed'
