# The Software Framework.

This directory and its subdirectories contain <ins>**anny and all**</ins> programming sources.

`The Software framework` is written 100% in [Python](https://www.python.org/), and it runs on the [Raspberry Pi (4b)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) located on the [PCB-Tester-Board](https://github.com/ate-org/PCB-Tester/tree/master/hardware/electronics/altium/PCB-Tester-Board).

A specific `PCB-Tester` implementations use the PCB-Tester-Template repo as a starting point to implement the specific hard- and software. The `PCB-Tester-Template` contains code, that once an implementation is finished (or later updated) it will create a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package (in the desired channel and with the desired environment) so `The Software framework` can pick up on it.
