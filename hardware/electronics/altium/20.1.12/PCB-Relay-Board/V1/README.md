#TODO:
- [ ] enlarge the number of relays from 48 to 64
- [ ] add an extra pin to the header(s) for SDA (The FTDI-Cables need 2 contacts for the SDA)
- [ ] add a header to the SPI interfaces (both on X7A15T-Fabric.schdoc)
- [ ] change J3 to a pull-down and a 2 pin header for writing, (but don't put the header itself), remove the jumper X35 from the schematics.
- [ ] change J4 to a pull-down and a 2 pin header for writing, (but don't put the header itself),remove the jumper X37 from the schematics.
- [ ] put some text on the LED's (top overlay) indicating the voltage level.
