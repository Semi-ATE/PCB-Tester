Bringup procedure for PCB-Tester-Board

0. Disconnect the 24V PSU (on the wall) from the PCB and remove the PCB from the housing.
1. Check if 24V from the PSU is provided with correct polarity (both plugs should be wired the same way).
2. Connect 230VAC to the power inlet and check if the PSU produces correctly 24V DC. If nothing happens, check the fuses in the drawer in the inlet.
On the PCB:
3. Check if there are no short-circuits at testpoints. Remove Raspberry Pi. Connect 24V DC to X2. Check if the board produces correctly 12V rail (TP5) and 5V rails (TP10, TP13).
4. Remove power, short jumper J15 (use tin or populate 0R) and place Raspberry Pi back in its socket.
5. Apply power, program IRPS5401. Use the config file from directory "firmware/PowIRCenter/Build <number>/PCB-Tester-Board" (currently, <number> is 7369).
6. Re-power the board. Check if IRPS5401 produces correctly the voltage rails: 1V (TP6), 1.8V (TP7), and 3.3V (TP9).
7. Remove power, short jumpers J5, J6, J9, J10, J11, J12 (use tin or populate 0R).
8. Apply power, program the configuration flash of the FPGA using the file from directory "firmware/vivado/<version>/PCB-Tester-Board" (currently <version> is 19.1).
9. Cycle power, check if the FPGA boots up (lits LED "DONE").

Bringup procedure for PCB-Relay-Board

0. Check if there are no short-circuits at testpoints and that (if populated) TVSes D7, D8, D9, D10, D11 are not pulling the voltage rail and the signals to GND. Prepare working PCB-Tester-Board. Position the PCB-Relay-Board in a free slot allowing access to the board.
1. Apply power, check if the 12V rail is ok (TP6), check the 5V rail (TP5) and the 3.3V rail (TP7).
2. Program IRPS5401. Use the config file from directory "firmware/PowIRCenter/Build <number>/PCB-Relay-Board" (currently, <number> is 7369).
3. Cycle power, check if the voltage rails are produced correctly: 1V (TP1), 1.8V (TP2), and 3.3V (TP4).
4. Remove power, remove the board from the slot. Short jumpers J1, J2, J4, J5, J8, J9 (use tin or populate 0R).
5. Position the board in the slot, apply power. Program the configuration flash of the FPGA using the file from directory "firmware/vivado/<version>/PCB-Relay-Board" (currently <version> is 19.1).
6. Cycle power, check if the FPGA boots up (lits LED "DONE").
